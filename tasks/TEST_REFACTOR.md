# Test Code Refactoring

This document tracks the refactoring of test code for the gh-project-manager-mcp project to meet the new testing standards.

## Status

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `tests/test_server.py` | ✅ Complete | Organized into `TestServerInitialization` class |
| `tests/test_config.py` | ✅ Complete | Created `TestConfigCompleteness` class |
| `tests/utils/test_gh_utils.py` | ✅ Complete | Organized into `TestResolveParam` and `TestRunGhCommand` classes |
| `tests/tools/test_issues.py` | ✅ Complete | Organized into 11 test classes with proper type annotations and Given/When/Then docstrings |
| `tests/tools/test_projects.py` | ✅ Complete | Organized into 8 test classes with proper type annotations and Given/When/Then docstrings |
| `tests/tools/test_pull_requests.py` | ✅ Complete | Organized into 6 test classes with proper type annotations and Given/When/Then docstrings |

## Completed Changes

All test files have been refactored with the following improvements:

1. **Class-based organization**: Tests are now grouped into logical classes by functionality
2. **Proper type annotations**: All test methods and parameters include type annotations
3. **Standardized docstrings**: Tests follow the Given/When/Then format for clarity
4. **Self parameter**: Class-based tests properly use the self parameter
5. **Return type annotations**: All test methods include `-> None` return type
6. **Consistent naming**: Removed redundant prefixes and standardized test names
7. **Fixture typing**: Added proper type hints for all fixtures
8. **TYPE_CHECKING imports**: Added conditional imports for test fixtures

## Testing Results

All 138 tests in the project are passing after the refactoring, confirming that the changes did not break any functionality.

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding more comprehensive tests for edge cases
2. Ensure all new test code follows the established standards
3. Refactor implementation code as needed to improve maintainability
